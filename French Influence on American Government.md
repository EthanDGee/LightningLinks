The French played a significant role in the founding of the American government, both directly and indirectly. During the [[American Revolution]], the French provided crucial military support to the American colonies, which was pivotal in securing victory against the British. This alliance not only helped in the battlefield but also in legitimizing the American cause on the global stage.

Moreover, French political philosophy heavily influenced the [[founding fathers]] and the creation of American political institutions. Enlightenment thinkers like Montesquieu and Rousseau provided frameworks for ideas such as the separation of powers and popular sovereignty, which were integral to the drafting of the [[declaration of independence]] and the United States Constitution. [[Thomas Jefferson]], who was an ambassador to France, was particularly influenced by these ideas, which is evident in his writings and contributions to American political thought.

The French Revolution, which followed the American Revolution, also reinforced the ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity, further embedding these principles into the American political ethos. Thus, the French impact on the founding of the American government is seen through both military alliances and ideological contributions that shaped the nation's foundational documents and principles.
